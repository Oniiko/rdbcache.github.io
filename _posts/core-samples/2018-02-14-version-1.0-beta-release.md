rdbcache stands for redis database cache. It is an open source database cache server. rdbcache uses redis as cache to offer asynchronous database cache api service. It provides eventually consistency between redis and database. rdbcache attempts to bridge the gap between redis and database.

The asynchronous nature makes rdbcache very fast and useful in many scenarios. Through few simple restful API endpoints, rdbcache offers the convenience for developers to easily take advantage of the powers and benefits of both redis and database.
